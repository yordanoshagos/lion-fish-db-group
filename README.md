We created a schema called malnutrition, which we used to store data on malnourished children undergoing a program. We also kept  track of their progress. 
In this schema, we have added 5 tables which are the children's table, parents' table, relationship table, medical status, and progress table. under which we have the respective data for the children, 
their parents, the relationship between the children and their parents, the medical history of the children, and their progress. we have used primary and foreign keys to connect the tables to each other.
